A 10-way Pokemon Classification using Deep Learning

Convolutional neural networks are deep artificial neural networks that are used primarily to classify images (e.g. name what they see), cluster them by similarity (photo search), and perform object recognition within scenes. They are algorithms that can identify faces, individuals, street signs, tumors, platypuses and many other aspects of visual data.

Note - There are two different models I used. These are based upon following research papers -
